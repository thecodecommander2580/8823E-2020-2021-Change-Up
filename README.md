# 8823E-2020-2021-Change-Up
An archive of code from 8823E during the VEX Change Up season.
This Branch contains the Light Test project. At the time, we didn't have an optical sensor to use for detecting the color of a Change Up ball. I tried to see if I could use two VEX flashlights and a light sensor to detect the color of the ball. In the end. I was unsuccessful.
